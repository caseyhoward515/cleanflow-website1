# Project Iteration History

This document provides a chronological log of each completed iteration, detailing the major changes and enhancements made to the project over time.

## Iteration One (branch: iteration-one-secure)

-   Added security hardening.
-   Created initial test files for core modules.

## Iteration Two (branch: iteration-two-docs)

-   Enhanced `README.md` with repository structure, quick-start, and “Project Modules.”
-   Updated `CODEBASE.md` to reflect full file/folder list.
-   Created `CONTRIBUTING.md` with bug/PR guidelines.
-   Added HTML comments in `index.html`, `services.html`, and `about.html`.
-   Added CSS comments in `style.css`.
-   Added JSDoc comments in `assets/main.js`.

## Iteration Three (branch: iteration-5-footer-fix)

-   Patched non-functional footer navigation links in `index.html`, `about.html`, and `services.html`.
-   Linked footer items (`Home`, `About`, `Services`, `Contact`) to their respective pages/sections.
-   Created and linked `privacy.html` and `terms.html` from the footer.
-   Added basic content to `privacy.html` (no cookie tracking, data use for service requests only).
-   Added basic content to `terms.html` (usage terms, liability disclaimer).
-   Implemented accessibility enhancements in footers (nav tags, aria-labels).
-   Updated `CODEBASE.md` to include `privacy.html` and `terms.html`.
-   Updated `docs/documentation.md` with this iteration's summary.

## Iteration 6 (branch: iteration-6-readme-aboutme)

-   **Initial Goal:** Add a new "About Me" section to the main `README.md` file.
-   **Outcome:** This approach was deemed inappropriate for the repository's scope. The "About Me" content was considered too personal for a project README, which should focus on the project itself rather than individual contributor details.
-   **Decision:** The changes to `README.md` in this iteration were not merged. A course correction was planned for Iteration 6.1.

## Iteration 6.1 (branch: iteration-6.1-aboutme-sitefix)

-   **Course Correction:** Address the "About Me" content appropriately by integrating it into the website, not the project's README.
-   **Actions Taken:**
    -   The `README.md` file was preserved in its clean state from Iteration 5 (no "About Me" section was added to it).
    -   The new "About Me" text, originally intended for the README, was correctly applied to the "Our Story" section within the `about.html` page of the website.
    -   No changes were made to `README.md` in this iteration.
-   **Confirmation:** The website's "About Me" section (specifically the "Our Story" part on `about.html`) was successfully updated with the intended content in this branch.
-   Updated `docs/documentation.md` with the history for Iterations 6 and 6.1.
